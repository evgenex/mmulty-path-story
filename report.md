h1. MULTI PATH STORY 
h3. A Dev Test for Impendulo Limited by Eugene Silovs.


h2. Tech stack used.
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Handlebars templates (express-handlebars)

h2. Aproach and implementation.
The main aspect of my approach is to separate the logic of the beck-end from the front-end. For that matter I decided to use a template engine. The one I’ve chosen is Handlebars because it’s simple, flexible and very well readable. 
The logic of the application is entirely controlled by the beck-end. All server routes are controlled by only one module (routes/home.js) mainly because it’s a very small application and I think it’s better to keep it compact. In case the application needs to be extended, I would prefer and recommend to split the routes in different modules. 

h2. Conclusion.
In my opinion the test is testing JavaScript skills along with ability to build basic server side applications using Node.js and Express.js. It also may reflect the candidate’s approach to finding a working solution.
